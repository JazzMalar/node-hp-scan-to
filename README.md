**`node-hp-scan-to`** is a Node.js application that replicates HP's "_Scan to Computer_" functionality by [reverse engineering](protocol_doc/HP%20Officejet%206500%20E710n-z.md) the original protocol, allowing you to scan documents directly from your HP printer's scanner to your Linux, Windows, or macOS computer.

Unlike the original HP program, `node-hp-scan-to` is cross-platform and can be ran on a bare-metal desktop or server, or in a container on Docker or Kubernetes. It can also be integrated with third-party document management solutions such as [Paperless-ngx](https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/) and [Nextcloud](https://Nextcloud.com/).

**Disclaimer:** `node-hp-scan-to` is not endorsed by nor affiliated with HP. The reverse engineering of the original HP Windows application's interaction with the device has been done independently.

#### CLI Commands

##### `listen`

By default, this app runs the `listen` command as the default mode. It will listen to the print for new job and trigger based on the selection on the device.

Run `npx node-hp-scan-to listen --help` to get the full list of command options.

##### `adf-autoscan`

Running `npx node-hp-scan-to adf-autoscan` will automatically trigger a scan job as soon as the ADF (automatic document feeder) on the printer's scanner is loaded with paper.

Run `npx node-hp-scan-to adf-autoscan --help` to get command line usage help.

You can also set the environment variable `MAIN_COMMAND="adf-autoscan"` with Docker. Example:

```sh
docker run -e MAIN_COMMAND="adf-autoscan --pdf" docker.io/manuc66/node-hp-scan-to:latest
```

##### `clear-registrations`

Running `npx node-hp-scan-to clear-registratons` will clear all registered targets on the device (useful for trial and error and debugging).

Run `npx node-hp-scan-to clear-registrations --help` to get command line usage help.

You can also set the environment variable `MAIN_COMMAND="clear-registrations"` with Docker. Example:

```sh
docker run -e MAIN_COMMAND="clear-registrations" docker.io/manuc66/node-hp-scan-to:latest
```

### Run with Docker

#### Public Pre-Built Docker image

- <https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/manuc66/node-hp-scan-to>

Be aware that with Docker you have to specify the IP address of the printer via the `IP` environment variable, because the Bonjour service discovery protocol uses multicast network traffic, which by default doesn't work in Docker.

You could however use Docker's [macvlan](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/drivers/macvlan/) networking, this way you can use service discovery and the `NAME` environment variable.

All scanned files are written to the volume `/scan`, the filename can be changed with the `PATTERN` environment variable. For the correct permissions to the volume set the environment variables `PUID` and `PGID` to that of the user running the container (usually `PUID=1000` and `PGID=1000`).

**Additional Notes:**

- The name shown on the printer‚Äôs display is the hostname of the Docker container, which defaults to a random value. You can override it by setting the `hostname` or using the `LABEL` environment variable.

- To enable debug logs set the environment variable `CMDLINE` to `-D`

#### Example for Docker

To build a local Docker image from this repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/manuc66/node-hp-scan-to.git
cd node-hp-scan-to
docker build . -t node-hp-scan-to
docker run -e IP=192.168.0.5 -e PGID=1000 -e PUID=1000 --hostname myComputer node-hp-scan-to
```

#### Example for Docker Compose

Create the following `docker-compose.yml` file into this directory:

```yml
services:
  node-hp-scan-to:
    image: docker.io/manuc66/node-hp-scan-to:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    hostname: node-hp-scan-to
    environment:
      # REQUIRED - Change the next line to the IP address of your HP printer/scanner:
      - IP=192.168.0.5
      # Name that your container will appear as to your printer:
      - LABEL=node-hp-scan-to
      # Set the timezone, such as "Europe/London":
      - TZ=UTC
      # Set the created filename pattern:
      - PATTERN="scan"_dd-mm-yyyy_hh-MM-ss
      # Run the Docker container as the same user ID as the host system:
      - PGID=1000
      - PUID=1000
      # Optional - enable autoscanning a document when loaded into the scanner:
      # - MAIN_COMMAND=adf-autoscan --pdf
      # If using Paperless-ngx, you can use its API to upload files:
      # - PAPERLESS_POST_DOCUMENT_URL="http://<paperless-host>:<port>/api/documents/post_document/"
      # - PAPERLESS_TOKEN= "xxxxxxxxxxxx..."
    volumes:
      - ./scan:/scan
```

Then run `docker-compose up -d`

### Run with Kubernetes

Apply the following manifest (the `PersistentVolumeClaim` must also be deployed beforehand):

```yml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
name: hp-scan-to
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app.kubernetes.io/name: hp-scan-to
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app.kubernetes.io/name: hp-scan-to
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: manuc66/node-hp-scan-to:master
          name: hp-scan-to
          env:
          - name: IP
            value: 192.168.0.5
          - name: PATTERN
            value: '"scan"_dd.mm.yyyy_hh:MM:ss'
          - name: PGID
            value: "1000"
          - name: PUID
            value: "1000"
          - name: LABEL
            value: scan
          - name: DIR
            value: /scans
          - name: TZ
            value: Europe/London
          resources:
            limits:
              memory: 256Mi
            requests:
              cpu: "0"
              memory: 64Mi
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /scans
              name: incoming-scans
      restartPolicy: Always
      volumes:
        - name: incoming-scans
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: incoming-scans
```

## Build Source Code

How to build and run the project's source code:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/manuc66/node-hp-scan-to.git
cd node-hp-scan-to
yarn install -d
yarn build
# Start the program with the printer's IP address:
node dist/index.js -a 192.168.1.5 
# Or start it with the name of the printer:
# node dist/index.js -n "Officejet 6500 E710n-z"
```

### Debugging

I'm using Visual Studio Code to debug this application, so instead of running _ts-node_, just run `code .` and press F5 to start debugging.

You may want to set your printers ip or name in `.vscode/launch.json`
